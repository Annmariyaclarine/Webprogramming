<p style= "border: 3px solid powderblue;margin: 50px;">A car (or automobile) is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one-to-eight people, have four wheels and mainly transport people rather than goods.
The English word car is believed to originate from Latin carrus/carrum "wheeled vehicle" or (via Old North French) Middle English carre "two-wheeled cart," both of which in turn derive from Gaulish karros "chariot".It originally referred to any wheeled horse-drawn vehicle, such as a cart, carriage, or wagon.

<h2 style="color:blue; text-decoration:underline;">Different types of cars available in india</h2>
<h3 style="color:red;">Hatch back</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Hatchbacks are one of the most popular car body types in terms of overall sales in India. A hatchback can be defined as a vehicle body type that comprises small cars with 4 doors along with an additional rear hatch that opens upward to access the boot space. Hatchbacks are generally designed with compact bodies, and are perfect for comfortably seating 4 passengers, despite a seating capacity of 5. Nonetheless, the most striking feature of this segment is the boot; a space behind the rear seats that exists inside the car itself, rather than as a separate space.

<h3 style="color:red;">Sedan</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Derived from the Latin term “sedere” which means “to sit”, sedans are designed to provide utmost comfort and convenience for passengers both at the front as well as the rear. The major component of a sedan is its longer body that’s built with a three-box configuration consisting of pillars identified as A, B, and C pillars. Compared to hatchbacks, sedans have a separate boot compartment, which exists as an addition to the vehicle’s bodyline. Thus, when you open up a sedan’s boot, you’re opening just the boot and not the car itself. With the boot being a separate compartment, a sedan can comfortably seat 5 passengers.

<h3 style="color:red;">SUV</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Quite popular in the Indian market, SUV is a car body-type that comprises vehicles that are both passenger vehicles as well as off-roaders. SUVs are generally large and measure well over the 4 meter mark, with compact SUVs being the exception, coming under 4 meters. Built with a tall bodyline, SUVs provide the driver with a commanding view of the road ahead. Moreover, SUVs have high ground clearance providing better terrain handling capability as well as a stance higher from the ground. This is a feature that makes them distinct from all other vehicle body-types.

<h3 style="color:red;">MUV</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Although the SUVs and MUVs are similarly designed, the two are inherently different. While SUVs are sporty off-roaders, MUVs are built for maximum practicality and utility. An MUV vehicle is thus a multipurpose vehicle that is often dubbed as a people’s carrier. Capable of seating as many as 10 people sometimes, MUVs are a bigger version of passenger cars that are mainly designed to transport passengers comfortably in cities and highways.

<h3 style="color:red;">Coupe</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
A body type that isn’t conventional like other bodylines, Coupes are known for their sporty avatar and aerodynamic stance. Unlike Sedans, SUVs, Hatchbacks and even MUVs, the most striking features of a Coupe, is the fact that it has two doors only. Coupes are characterized by their two-doors, three-box design, fixed roof, and sleeker roofline. And even though Coupes are generally two-door, modern day OEMs are also manufacturing four door Coupes, which are generally given characteristics like a sloping roofline, and a sportier stance.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
When it comes to vehicle body-types, there is nothing more desirable than a convertible. Convertible cars are a body-type that is characterized either by a foldable or a completely removable roof. Generally, the roof on-board a convertible is made up of canvas or vinyl material, but it can also be a hard top. This allows you to feel the wind in your hair as you drive and provides nothing short of pure driving pleasure

<h3 style="color:red;">Pickup Trucks</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Pickup trucks are a fairly unique vehicle body-type, offering immense utility in a package that is usable. The unique feature of this body type is that there is a large open cargo space behind the passenger section. This cargo space provides high payload capacity that combines well with the off-roading capability as well as passenger carrying ability of a pickup truck.
